\value{
a list containing the number of formulated models (n.mods),
the correlation matrix returned by a call to check.correlations (predictor.correlations),
and a complete list of the model formula that will be fitted by a call to
full.subsets.gam (mod.formula)
}
\description{
A function to generate a complete model set as would be fitted by full.subsets.gam
but without fitting the actual model set.
