\usage{
check.non.linear.correlations(dat)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{the data.frame containing the columns for which a correlation
matrix is sought.}
}
\value{
an approximate correlation matrix
}
\description{
generates a correlation matrix among all columns of a data.frame
}
\details{
The function uses gam to estimate a correlation coefficient
among continuous variables (continuous~s(continuous), lm to approximate the correlation coefficient
between a continuous variable (as response) and a factor variable (as a predictor)
through the call lm(continuous~factor),
and nnet to apporoximate the correlation for factor variables as responses using a multnomial
model fit through a call to multinom(factor~factor) or (factor~continuous).
}
\note{
The resulting "correlation" matrix is assymetric as the row variable
is used as the "response" and the column variable is used as the "predictor".
The use of gam may be slightly oversensitive for continuous-continuous correlations
and users may wish to increase cor.cutoff. Inspect individual replationships manually.
Values are only approximate "correlations" and are in fact the sqrt of the
R-square values reported for each of the fitted relationships. Note that the function
assumes a gaussian distribution for continuous response variables. Substantial
deviations from this assumption will yield spurious "correlation" estimates.
