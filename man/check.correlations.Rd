\title{check.correlations}
\usage{
check.correlations(dat, parallel = F, n.cores = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{the data.frame containing the columns for which a correlation
matrix is sought.}

\item{parallel}{a logical indicating if calaculation of the correlation matrix
should be done in parallel. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{n.cores}{a numeric value indicating the number of cores to utilise if
parallel is TRUE.}
}
\value{
a correlation matrix
}
\description{
generates a correlation matrix among all columns of a data.frame
}
\details{
The function uses cor to calcualte the Pearson correlation coefficient
among continuous variables, lm to approximate the correlation coefficient
among a continuous variable and a factor variable through the call lm(continuous~factor),
and nnet to apporoximate the correlation among factor variables using a multnomial
model fit.
